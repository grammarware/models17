# Partial Evaluation of OCL Expressions
Bastian Ulke, Friedrich Steimann and Ralf LÃ¤mmel


(latest revision of the accepted paper available at http://www.feu.de/ps/prjs/models2017.pdf)


Our artifact contribution consists of the following three parts:

1. The metamodel for Java/JPA programs and 14 instances, constructed from Open Source projects, as well as the 76 OCL expressions reflecting JPA's rules of well-formedness.

2. A Java SE-based setup of our Java-based OCL partial evaluator. This application can be used to reproduce evaluation results presented in our paper and to get an impression of the complexity reduction achieved by partially evaluating OCL expressions.

3. A virtual machine, comprising a preconfigured Eclipse workspace to inspect the implementation of our partial evaluator for OCL.

Parts (2) and (3) contain own README files with further details on their usage.
